Tabular data as published on the web is often not well formatted
and structured. Messytables tries to detect and fix errors in the
data. Typical examples include:

* Finding the header of a table when there are explanations and
  text fragments in the first few rows of the table.
* Guessing the type of columns in CSV data.

This library provides data structures and some heuristics to
fix these problems and read a wide number of different tabular
abominations.
